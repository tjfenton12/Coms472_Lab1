Question a
The heuristic function I've devised is a linear combination of the three bullets of information provided in the lab
document. Because there seems to be no indication of scaling between each bullet
    - The more QUERY words on a page, the more likely the links on that page lead to the goal node
    - The more QUERY words in the hypertext associated with a hyperlink, the more likely that hyperlink leads to the
        goal node
    - The more consecutive and in numerical order QUERY words there are in a hyperlink, the more likely that hyperlink
        leads to the goal node

A) Each QUERY word on a page will award the heuristic one point.
B) Each QUERY word in a hyperlink will award the heuristic one point.
C) A hyperlink with "Query1 Query2 Query3" in the hyperlink will award the heuristic three points.
D) A hyperlink with "Query1 Query2" in the hyperlink will award the heuristic two points.
E) A hyperlink with "Query1" in the hyperlink will award the heuristic one point.

The heuristic for each outgoing edge shall be the sum of the above rules, evaluated in order A -> E.

This heuristic is not admissible, as the heuristic value could become larger than the distance from the current node
to the goal node.

Question b
Done.

Question c
My heuristic function worked particularly well. With the required beam width of 20, my algorithm found a goal node
    9 nodes - intranet1
    17 nodes - intranet5
    11 nodes - intranet7
Using the beam search method. It performed the same when using best search as well, probably due to the beam width set
to 20.
On a standard breadth first search, it traversed
    91 nodes - intranet1
    88 nodes - intranet5
    56 nodes - intranet7.
On a standard depth first search, it traversed
    58 nodes - intranet1
    42 nodes - intranet5
    12 nodes - intranet7.
It is on that basis that I have concluded that my heuristic function has performed particularly well.
